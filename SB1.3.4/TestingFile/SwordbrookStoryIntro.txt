Long ago, in the kingdom of Swordbrook, an intensely talented and curious wizard named Zephyrdantus Thalassimere began exploring means of attempting to revive extinct species through the use of magic.
 
Through great effort he eventually achieved some success and became renowned for returning a type of recently extinct mouse into the wild. However, while his research partners, assistants, and friends celebrated the invention of this new type of spell, the achievment failed to satiate the young wizards desire for acclaim. Zephyrdantus became obsessed with the power of dragons, and spent many years studying the ancient texts and legends of these magnificent creatures.

Eventually, the wizard discovered a powerful spell that would allow him to transform himself into a dragon. With this new form, he believed he could rule over all the lands of Swordbrook, and become the most feared and powerful creature in the realm.

But something went wrong during the transformation. The wizard's body was consumed by the dark magic, and he emerged as a twisted and corrupted version of a dragon. His body was larger and more powerful than any dragon ever seen before, with razor-sharp claws and teeth, and a wingspan so large that it could blot out the sun.

The wizard, now known as the Great Tyrant Dragon, began to ravage the lands of Swordbrook. He burned villages, destroyed cities, and killed anyone who stood in his way. The people of Swordbrook were powerless to stop him, and the land fell into darkness and despair.

But hope was not lost. Every thousand years, a new generation of adventurers would arise, ready to face the Great Tyrant Dragon and defeat him once and for all. These brave men and women would come from all corners of Swordbrook, and would unite to form an army capable of taking down the Great Tyrant Dragon.

Each time the Great Tyrant Dragon was defeated, the land of Swordbrook would experience a period of peace and prosperity. But the people knew that he would eventually return, and that they would need a new generation of adventurers to rise up and defeat him once again.

And so the cycle continued, with each generation of adventurers becoming more skilled and powerful than the last. They would train for years, hone their skills and abilities, and prepare themselves for the ultimate battle against the Great Tyrant Dragon.

But no matter how many times the Great Tyrant Dragon was defeated, the people of Swordbrook knew that he would always return. And so they remained ever vigilant, ready to call upon the next generation of adventurers to rise up and defend their land from the greatest threat it had ever known.
